### **Project Goals**

In this project, I'll be using flexbox to design and build the layout for my company's homepage. I can choose to build a new homepage for an existing company or imagine my own dream company!

### **Setup Instructions**

If I choose to do this project on my computer instead of Codecademy, I can download what I'll need by clicking the "Download" button below. If I need help setting up my computer, I can read an article about setting up a text editor for HTML/CSS development.# Company-homepage
